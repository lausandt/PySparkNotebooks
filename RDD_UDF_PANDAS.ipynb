    "#### RDD\n",
    "\n",
    "PySpark's DataFrame object can be manipulated with a host of methods. Spark will use those manipulations and create an optimised query plan for execution. However, a DataFrame has constraints; we cannot randomly determine what is in a column, for instance. PySpark dictates that all column entries are of the same data type. But what if our data has different types? What if we want to write our own Python functions to manipulate data?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the resilient distributed dataset (RDD). Though I presume that the DataFrame will be enough as the state you need for data manupilation, there are two use cases for the RDD:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have an unordered collection of Python objects that can be pickled.\n",
    "2. You have unordered key-value pairs like a Python dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I would not be surprised if you had never heard of [pickling](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html). A pickle is the Python method for serialising objects. Serialising objects is the process of translating an object's state into a format that can be stored, transmitted, and reconstructed. If you operate in a distributed environment (multiple computers at possibly multiple locations) and you want to perform manipulation of the state (remember, Python is an imperative programming language; it manipulates state; the object in Python is the representation of the state), you need to ensure that all computers that perform operations do this on the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "I say all of this while thinking it will be nothing more than some useful background information, but it hardly gives you any insight into a RDD. To understand an RDD, we should go back to the DataFrame. The DataFrame is primarily about columns; the vast majority of the `pyspark.sql` API is about manipulating columns. One of the most important attributes of a column is that the elements in that column have to have the same type (int, string, etc.). The RDD does not have this constraint; it is basically a set theoretic bag*. You can mix types; you can have multiplicity in a bag. I use the set theory example because set theory is the basis upon which all relational algebra (SQL) is based. You can consider an RDD to be row-like, for in tabular data the rows can have multiple types. A Python list is akin to a set theoretic bag; let's use an example with a list.\n",

The reason behind this is simple: we distribute the workload over several nodes; therefore, we need to know that if we combine the partial results, it does not matter in what order they come in or what the grouping is. Obviously, PySparks reduce does not check that the functions have these properties. This would take some serious math; you would have to prove these properties for all functions you give as an argument to reduce."

    "1. The RDD allows for more flexibility compared to the DataFrame.\n",

    "3. The API for RDD is heavily inspired by Google's MapReduce. Apache Hadoop is an open-source variation of MapReduce.\n",
    "4. Using the `udf` function, we can promote Python functions to work with DataFrames. It is like mapping the Python function to the DataFrame.\n",
    "5. You have to be careful with your data design; the types of your function input and output must be comparable to PySpark types.\n",

    "With Pandas we can start treating big data as nothing more than a bunch of small data, using Series UDF for column transformations. The simplest of the Pandas UDFs are the series UDFs. The series UDF is a one-dimensional Numpy ndarray. A numpy ndarray is actually an N-dimensional array, based upon the Fortran and C contiguous arrays. An instance of class ndarray consists of a contiguous one-dimensional segment of computer memory (owned by the array or by some other object) combined with an indexing scheme that maps N integers into the location of an item in the block. This construct makes the numpy ndarray very fast, much faster than a Python collection such as a list or tuple.\n",

    "The Pandas series object takes a Column object as input and returns a Column object as output. In PySpark, it is mostly used to make use of the Pandas library, but also of all those libraries that Pandas works excellent with. Libraries such as Numpy (obviously), scikit-learn, and statsmodel all operate seamlessly with Pandas and thus in PySpark.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can basically promote a Pandas (or friends) function to the distributed world of PySpark. If you are like me, then you straight away wonder how, after all, the numpy ndarray is that fast because it is contiguous in memory, ergo on one computer. This is solved by using [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) with its in-memory columnar data format.\n",

An iterator provides a way to access the elements of an aggregated object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

You can implement the `__iter__` function in the iterable class and create an iterator class to perform the actual iteration. By doing so, you follow [the design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern#) strictly. The Pythonic way is to use a generator function, you write a generator by using the yield keyword in the body of the function. Yield kan suspend and pick up where it left. \n",

    "#### Code comment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Like the previous code and unlike Rioux's code, I think the conversion functions are general functions and should be kept out of the larger functions. This prevents clutter in your code.\n",
    "2. This does not apply to $\\lambda$ functions. I use a lambda here because I assign a whole series of None values to a Pandas Series object.\n",
    "3. Python does not know constants as other programming languages do. For instance, in Java, you have the final key word: `public static final double kelvin = 273.15`. Python's typing library knows the type `Final`, which indicates a constant. If you use MyPy, you will get an error if the constant is reassigned somewhere. The interpeter will not throw an error and just make the change. I opt for leaving these constants out of the function; they are general constants. If I put them in the function `temp_to_temp_converter`, I will change the scope of these constants to just that function. I therefore cannot use these constants outside of my function, though I might want to. There are ways to prevent such random access in Python, but that is out of the scope of this notebook; therefore, I just wrote some comments"
